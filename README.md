# UnitySpaceShooterExercise
Space Shooter Exercise Tutorial from Unity, with some own implementations (assets, code, logic etc.)

#What's this about?
This is the "second" follow along project of the Unity tutorials. Though I've followed along until the asteroids part, after that,
ie. enemy coming down, evading, firing upon you, bonus object (with self-provided asset) and it's effect on the game, all of that was done
by me, ie. no code referencing, and looking how things were tied together. That was challenging, but also fun. Now I understand Unity a
little better. Looking forward to incrementally self-provide all parts of a game while I'm learning Unity.
